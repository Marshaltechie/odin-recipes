    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ½ cups (315g) all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
      <li>2 ¼ tsp (1 packet) active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>¾ cup (180ml) warm water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, mix warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about
        5–10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
      </li>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt.</li>
      <li>Pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
      <li>
        Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 7–10 minutes,
        until smooth and elastic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly oil a bowl, place the dough inside, cover it with a damp cloth,
        and let it rise for 1–1.5 hours (or until doubled in size).
      </li>
    </ol>
